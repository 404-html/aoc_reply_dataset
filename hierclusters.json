They can get lots of aid from UN, community of nations and the USA. | How do the GND captains of industry propose to make this stuff a reality. Order GM to produce electric cars in Lordstown? Subsidize the electric cars? Electric cars don\u2019t solve a GHG problem unless the power base is shifted first. Heck, Congress can\u2019t even condemn anti-Semitism. | Where is the cost benefit analysis and alternatives evaluation. The principles of the National Environmental Policy Act require alternatives analysis. The GND is a porcine Frankenstein stitched together to support an irresponsible emotional pork barrel appeal. #GreenOink! | Should not be the case. Can\u2019t have \u201cone man one vote\u201d representation and dillute that with non-voters. Of course the left wants to vote non citizens. We\u2019ll see how that plays out. | I am not demeaning the contributions of immigtants. In the 1960s the SCOTUS formulated the \u201cone man one vote principlefor legislative apportionment. To square with that Congress should represent those who legally vote. Longstanding policy has been that citizens vote. | Show the evidence that these extreme weather events are caused by warming. The IPCC has consistently written we don\u2019t have sufficient science to make the linkage & it could be cheaper to adapt than invest in iffy energy that\u2019s dangerously untested. Who\u2019s your economist? Mary J? | I won\u2019t quibble about the duality of the power ploy but citizen representation meets my own sense of fairness. You are free to believe Non-citizens ought to count. | Non-citizens should NOT count for apportionment. There\u2019s no compelling case for counting them. | Of course we know the slavers insisted on counting the slaves to advance the cause of sustaining slavery by increasing Southern representation in Congress. Counting non-citizens is also political power ploy. Are you serious about pleading the Deep South defense? | Justice Democrats? Nonsense. They are the Justin Democrats as in Justin Fairfax. They do nothing to root him out. They preach but don\u2019t practice. | We need to also identify the \u201cclimate hysteriac\u201d\n\u2014 a person so seized with climate change that they cast aside rational thought, refuse to analyze alternatives, costs/benefits, and rashly advocate extreme plans like GND. They harm the cause of a rational response. | That\u2019s a lame defense of a take over of the US energy sector. And how does this \u201cexistential threat\u201d justify a government takeover of health care and a Jaun Perron tax system. Stick to the problem. GND is just cheap demagoguery! | What a moron to construct such a wild a\u2014 theory of liabilty. If she takes Uber, she benefits from lower gas prices facilitated by the pipeline. @AOC is more culpable for impacts of pipeline than Sloan!  It\u2019s good everyone understands she\u2019s a ditz! How many more Dems like this? | Maybe we can start a litany of the imperfect Democrats. We can start.\n\u2014 Woodrow Wilson was a white supremacist. \n\u2014 Bill Clinton was a sexual predator \n\u2014 Hilary enabled Bill\n\u2014 FDR ignored the holocaust\n\u2014 Senate Dems post New Deal worked with southerners to filibuster Civil Rights | It\u2019s absolutely true. In terms of our economic future, the Green New Deal is the bottom. We could only go up. That\u2019s merely an observation that GND is a collection of linked and extreme alternatives formulated without rigorous cost benefit analysis. Who would contribute to this? | Their prating and babbling helps the cause of traditional conservative principles and values. They are so crazy. Please encourage them to continue talking crazy.", "\u2018The last 8 years\u2019\n\nSo, all of it?\n\nAlso, remember how Obama inherited the Recession and got things building upwards again, in part through \u2018socialist\u2019 policies like ACA, setting a growth rate that is still continuing to this day? | It\u2019s also worth noting that higher taxation on the rich was done to great effect from the end of WWII through to the 60\u2019s, which is when there was one of the largest booms in American economic growth.\n\nThen major tax overhauls started protecting the rich. And things slowed. | She\u2019s the one fighting to reduce taxation on lower income individuals and families while also expanding how much they earn. | Denmark also has a much smaller level of wealth inequality, and an overall higher quality of life index. | Every member of congress is given a budget for paying their staff. AOC has opted to use that budget to its full extent, rather than paying minimums to her staff.\n\nSo while they are being paid more, there is no higher cost to taxpayers. The money is already allocated. | How long has the running joke been, \u2018I got my college degree to be a barrista\u2019? | Social-capitalism does however, as evidenced by most 1st world nations having some blend of the two. | If someone can start a company and make it in life, great. More power to them.\n\nDo they have to do it paying their employees so little they need second or third jobs to stay afloat? | Regardless of where we stand on this issue, I do think we can al agree on the irony of the generation built on government subsidization being so against it now. | Local woman is all about people thinkin for themselves while also proudly sporting the banner of a man who outright lies constantly. pic.twitter.com/zO0Zkl184c | Considering she is advocating here for something she has long made part of her platform that got her elected, I\u2019d dare argue she is, in fact, speaking to her constituents. | Which fake news about Mueller exactly? He has found a huge number of crimes in Trumps direct orbit, and based on indictements proof a very large effort was made by a foreign power to help him be elected. | Further, cows primarily release methane through burps, and the amount can be vastly reduced by changing their diet. | Notice the first lines. \n\n\u201c...a full and thorough investigation of the Russian government\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election...\u201d\n\nHe is also, relevant to b)(ii), authorized to investigate any other crimes uncovered.Before the report, he has done this. pic.twitter.com/au6YeMKULY | To own the libs, clearly.\n\n(Also careful mentioning Trek.

Think of it as an investment; US capital is put into developing the technology, and then other nations can buy it from the US, increasing US GDP.(/Fin) | By a department that Trump cut funds from, no less. | Eliminate outright, no.\n\nBut you can mitigate the symptoms and reduce the damage. | America was paying to reduce its own emissions. At 14% of total world wide emissions, it is the second highest producer, and thus has nearly the most to reduce (beaten by China only).\n\nIt is also a service-driven nation, and thus well positioned (/1) | Actually, the goal is to improve air travel so as to be less polluting, while also investing in infrastructure to provide more options that are less expensive and more green in place of air travel. | Only three nations have not committed to lowering greenhouse emissions.\n\nOne of them used to also be committed to it, but then Trump was elected. | That\u2019s 14% of total world wide.\n\nOnly China produces more out of nearly 300 nations.\n\nAlso worth noting America is well positioned to develop tech and methods that can then be sold worldwide. | Heavy Boots. | Which leads to disparity in the education received.\n\nIt creates a natural barrier; kids from more poverty-prone areas receive lower tiers of education, making it more difficult to move themselves out of poverty, making it more likely their children receive the same. | Ah yes, the old \u2018you\u2019re not from the country so you have no idea, city slicker\u2019 argument. Well played.\n\nCan you dispute that the majority of methane produced by cows comes from burps? Nows your time to show up a dumb city hippy, c\u2019mon now! | You seem to have missed some details.\n\nGND will not \u2018outlaw\u2019 air travel, simply try to reduce dependancy on it by expanding alternatives.\n\n(Also, we\u2019re both using an instantaneous form of long distance communication that renders cross country travel for meetings needless). | She actuall proposes creating more eco friendly alternatives widely available, not getting rid of them. | You\u2019re really bouncing around here.\n\nFirst, no one is saying smaller states arent important. Not sure where you get that from.\n\nSecond, no one is claimin. It is a quick and easy fix.\n\nThird, I\u2019m curious where you get that cost? | Electric cars vs traditional gas guzzlers, high speed trains, more fuel efficient airplanes, more robust public transportation and infrastructure. | Speaking as someone whose brother was born premature, was known to be born premature, but whose mother was pressured to carry him to term knowing he likely wouldnt survive (spoiler, he didnt), only to warch him suffer for two weeks before finally being allowed to pass?(/1) | Mueller has turned a profit and resulted in the exposure of multiple crimes.\n\nBenghazi was how much, how long and how little? | Mueller has cost the government approximately $17million.\n\nDue to the crimes uncovered by him, Paul Manafort has had to forfeit $22million.\n\nProfit. | \u2018Grug hear from Dug that water rise!\u2019\n\n\u2018Dug just want communal housing so him not eaten by sabertooth.

It\u2019s a simple binary distinction to me.(/Fin) | She did categorically deny it. Try to pay attention for more than a few days sweety. | Electric engines are more eco friendly than a diesel engine. And while current methods have room for improvement, the whole point of GND is to invest in that improvement.\n\nSame with public transportation. Bad now? Why not make it better. | Then as I said in my other tweet I stand corrected and humbled. | Let me see if I follow you here.\n\nBecause she doesnt have the savings to do this, she is demonstrating how privelleged she is compared to pelple who do not have the savings to do that? | Fair enough. I\u2019ll answer it like this.\n\nI don\u2019t consider a fetus alive. Not in the same way a child is.\n\nIt\u2019s a work in progress. It isn\u2019t yet born. It isn\u2019t developed fully.\n\nIt\u2019s a collection of cells that will be a child someday, but arent yet.(/1) | If the mother is at risk of serious harm or death from the birth, is it right to sacrifice her for a child who might grow up without her?\n\nWhat about if she\u2019s raped? Is it right to force that on her?\n\nWhat about a mother who is unable to care for the child or provide for it? | Except for abortion. Or free trade. Religions a grey area, but if you want to protest let\u2019s work on reducing that right too. Also really important that elections are as difficult to partake in as possible.\n\nBut yeah!

When the government makes mistakes people should not try and repeat those mistake, but rather avoid making them again and trying to ensure that they don't happen again.  This is what @AOC is doing. I wish more politicians cared as much as she does. | These women, including you @AOC, are the protagonists in future history books. | Rules in Washington apparently only apply to male Republicans. | Fox News acts like they condemn statements by these two buffoons, but in reality it's what makes their base come back for more.  Fox News has a responsibility to FIRE these clowns for such remarks, not just pretend to reprimand them. | Rules apparently only apply to Democrats. | Another example of big corporations putting the interest of their shareholders over the interest of the country, the American people, and the environment.  This is why we need more regulations when it comes to environmental concerns, not less! | Laura Ingraham is just doing the \u201cFox News Thing.\u201d  In other words, she\u2019s spreading lies , hate and propaganda. | Trump's already neglecting citizens in blue states, as well as Puerto Rico.  He's already threatened FEMA funds in California.  It's a disgrace.  This President does not have America's interests at heart.  He only has the interests of his voters at heart. | Thank you for being so real. | The opposite of progressive is \u201cregressive.\u201d  It should work everywhere except when you are reading history books. | Unlike Trump, you don\u2019t need to frame a fake Time Magazine to hang on your wall. | Only crazy people use pictures of Ronald Reagan riding a Dinosaur that\u2019s carrying an American flag, to try and prove a point. | Anyone who disagrees with this is really un-American. | I wouldn\u2019t allow this lady to stand in the same building as my children.  She is the epitome of an evil witch. | These are all things that will benefit America in many ways, not just environmentally but economically as well.  These are all means to create new jobs.  I support the #GreenNewDeal | Yesterday GOP congressman Jim Jordan used an anti-Semitic trope to refer to @TomSteyer, and not a single GOP member reprimanded him.  I'm not even seeing Democratic leaders reprimanding him.  As a Jewish man, I am not offended by Ilhan's remarks but I am offended by Jordan's. | Yet this same man refuses to hold a vote to make the Mueller report public. Mitch McConnell must be voted out in 2020. | Thank you for being one of the few U.S. Representatives to really dig deeply into these actions.  Your line of questioning is really thought out and it really exposes these men for their conspiracy to attack the U.S. Constitution. | The GOP attacks her because what she\u2019s doing is exposing their party. | The youth of this nation is inspiring.  The old white dudes in politics need to take some pointers from our future generations.  That's one bright spot in this country: Our youth! | This is Fox News trying to make their base think you are irrelevant. | The good thing is that there is no DOJ policy against indicting a sitting United States Secretary of Commerce. | When they don\u2019t want something to be true, they just make up elaborate reasons for how and why their wishful thinking is true. They live in a fantasy world where they have imaginary power. | Lock Him Up! | What are the odds that the Trump family were accepted to college based on money rather than merits? | Violence in general should never be tolerated.  Hateful rhetoric by the U.S. President should never be tolerated either.  There comes a time when Americans need to stand up and say \"Enough is Enough\" to the hate. | This is all they do.  They create FAKE crimes so that crimes committed by Trump don\u2019t seem as bad. | Why do these executives get off with merely paying fines from the companies they work for.  They are the ones making these decisions.  They deserve to go to prison! | Our next Episode of @KrassenCast focuses on another right wing media outlet, Big League Politics, that attacked you for bogus FEC allegation, but they are actually working with PACs themselves. | I believe a wall would end more lives than it would save.  If this money that Trump is trying to unconstitutionally take for the wall was to go to real problems like the opioid crisis, the amount of lives saved would be huge.  They simply don't care about American lives. | And Trump admitted to sexually assaulting women.  I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d take someone who drives cars before someone who assaults women, any day. | It's my opinion that every student who wants an education should have the same right to that education no matter the color of their skin, their religion, or their economic background.  We need to fix this mess, and give everyone a fair chance in America. | Another example of how every vote counts.  Thank you Democrats. | It\u2019s the old GOP hacks who don\u2019t know what they are talking about.  They don\u2019t even understand how the internet works. | After this tweet, membership in the Girl Scouts will skyrocket, rightfully so. | This is amazing news.  Now only if we can get Trump\u2019s people to stop as well. | Just another attempt by Conservatives to demean condemn females for being strong human beings.  If anything we should stop buying Trump Vodka because he's such a failure. Oh wait, Trump vodka no longer exists.  Another Trump failure. | As far as I'm concerned, when Fox News attacks you, you gain points in my book. To me, it's the biggest compliment any rational politician can be given. | Why is no one mentioning Jim Jordan's anti-Semitic trope that he tweeted just days ago?  Why is it OK for GOP members to be blatantly anti-Semitic, but not OK for Democrats to call out policy toward another country? | Our future generations will look back and ask, \u201chow the hell were our Republican ancestors so dumb?\u201d | BOOM! | Exactly.  Climate change is a REAL National Emergency. | You could save innocent children from a fire, and Fox News would find some way to try and make you look bad. | I am not against ICE, but I am against the way that President Trump is running ICE.  Congress needs to put an end to Trump\u2019s policies, not an end to ICE. | The Immigrant Detention Centers are not run by ICE.  We need to stick to the facts.  Let's not stray from facts like the GOP is doing. | I am not defending ICE.  I just don't think they need to be abolished, and this is coming from someone who was a victim of an ICE raid.  They were formed to help protect us from terrorism.  I think that needs to be their main focus. | I don\u2019t have the stomach or self control to deal with the other party. | Thank you @AOC for your well-thought out questions.  Together the Democrats are in fact cracking the armor around Trump's lies and corruption. | And then Mitch McConnell refuses to hold votes for policies that he knows both parties would support, simply because he is Trump\u2019s stooge. | The only problem is that today\u2019s wealthy Republicans and the corporations that fund the Republicans don\u2019t care about society.  They just care about their power and wealth. | Why are Republicans so against progress?  What do they want to move this country back in time? | The same people calling taxpayer-funded healthcare \"socialism\", drive their kids on taxpayer-funded roads to taxpayer-funded schools on a daily basis, while they go to work and contribute to social security every week. | That\u2019s why you and so many other Democrats like you were elected in 2018.  Let\u2019s fix this shit! | All it is is fear mongering by the right.  There are so many on the right who don\u2019t actually care about human lives or safety, but rather about holding onto office. | When our privacy no longer is embraced by the U.S. government and by U.S. corporations, we no longer are given the rights that the U.S. Constitution promises us.  We are individuals and we deserve our individual privacy. | Better than writing a check from a bank account that is made of laundered Russian rubles. | Hopefully our kids will be smart enough to actually do something about climate change. | Getting big money out of politics means that Republicans will no longer win elections, unless they start caring about facts, science and the people whom they represent. | Your 2024 Presidential campaign slogan should be, \u201cUntil you do it, I\u2019m the boss.\u201d | Republicans call you \"Radical.\"\nWe call you \"Refreshing.\" | And this isn\u2019t a \u201csocialistic idea.\u201d It\u2019s a humanitarian idea. | Please have the House Oversight Committee investigate this. https://hillreporter.com/bombshell-new-allegations-kushner-appears-to-be-extorting-qatari-government-29169\u00a0\u2026 | Keep doing what you are doing.
